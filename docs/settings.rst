Specifying the settings
=======================

Pelican is configurable thanks to a configuration file, that you can pass to
the command line::

    $ pelican -s path/to/your/settingsfile.py path

Settings are given as the form of a python module (a file). You can have an
example by looking at `/samples/pelican.conf.py
<https://github.com/ametaireau/pelican/raw/master/samples/pelican.conf.py>`_

All the settings identifiers must be set in caps, otherwise they will not be
processed.

Here are the available settings. Please note that all the settings you put in
this file will be passed to the templates as well.

Themes
======

3 themes are available. You can specify them using the `-t` option:

* notmyidea
* simple (a synonym for "full text" :)
* martyalchin

You can define your own theme too, and specify it's emplacement in the same
way (be sure to specify the full absolute path to it).

Here is `a guide on how to create your theme
<http://alexis.notmyidea.org/pelican/themes.html>`_

The `notmyidea` theme can make good use of the following settings. I recommend
to use them too in your themes.

=======================   =======================================================
Setting name              what it does ?
=======================   =======================================================
`DISQUS_SITENAME`         Pelican can handle disqus comments, specify the
                          sitename you've filled in on disqus
`GITHUB_URL`              Your github URL (if you have one), it will then
                          use it to create a github ribbon.
`GOOGLE_ANALYTICS`        'UA-XXXX-YYYY' to activate google analytics.
`LINKS`                   A list of tuples (Title, Url) for links to appear on
                          the header.
`SOCIAL`                  A list of tuples (Title, Url) to appear in the "social"
                          section.
=======================   =======================================================

In addition, you can use the "wide" version of the `notmyidea` theme, by
adding that in your configuration::

    CSS_FILE = "wide.css"
